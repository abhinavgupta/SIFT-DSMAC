This document will tell you the ideal parameters for the test images here.

1. TEST.png swiss.png -> resize of 0.09 and 10 matches
2. object.png scene.png -> resize of 0.3 and 5 matches
3. object2.png scene.png -> resize of 0.1 and 5 matches


The box box_in_scene are the best images to try your hands by varying the parameters.

As you can in see the object object2 series, the closer zoomup makes a difference in the resize parameter 
keeping the matches parameter rather constant, thus showing that in a UAV aaplication, once a thorough 
callibration is done, the final output depends on the zoomout parameter and thus the height of the vehicle.
