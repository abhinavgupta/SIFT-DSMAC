README:


This code is a SIFT based trackers for UAV applications. The tracker is meant for DMSAC purposes

DSMAC: Digital Scene Matcher and Area Co-relator

What it tries to do is to match a given input from a UAV and match it to a large map.

Since the input object is highly scaled out in the map scene. It is necessary to use PryDown functions to make it easier for them to match.

Certain other boosts in the SIFT codes makes the performance in this DMSAC to around 30ms. The upgrades are already pulled into the new OpenCV 2.4.2
 (For reference, this pulls involved changes in the Lehviestien distance measurement and the feature calculations)

REQUIREMENTS:

OpenCV 2.4.2
CMake 2.8

BUILDIING FROM SOURCE:

1. USE CMAKE

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

This should make the required files and the executable as well


RUNNING THE CODE:

./SIFT_descriptor <img1> <img2> <resize parameter in power of two> <threshold multiplier for min distance>

img1 : Object Image (This will be the zoomed in version)
img2 : Scene Image (This will be the Map version, scaled out as compared to the object image)
resize parameter : This parameter is to give a power index to scale down the image. An input k will scale down by 2^k (In an UAV, this parameter will be a function of height of the UAV)
Threshold multipler for min distance: Depending on the number of "good matches" recived, this parameter will give an appropriate multipler to filter out the best possible matches. Heuristically can be made a function of the resize parameter and consequently the height.
